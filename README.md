We have not yet reached the UI, but the good vibe & fealling guides us and it's seems that it will lead to a pleasant and enjoibale user experience - it shure there is what to excpect while we paint this idees into the reality. | ![tll](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91435534/136754130-55c405d0-8864-4052-b3de-f7522dd6b251.png)
